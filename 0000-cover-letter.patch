Subject: [PATCH V3 00/23] Metadump v2
To: linux-xfs@vger.kernel.org
Cc: djwong@kernel.org,
    cem@kernel.org

Hi all,

This patch series extends metadump/mdrestore tools to be able to dump
and restore contents of an external log device. It also adds the
ability to copy larger blocks (e.g. 4096 bytes instead of 512 bytes)
into the metadump file. These objectives are accomplished by
introducing a new metadump file format.

I have tested the patchset by extending metadump/mdrestore tests in
fstests to cover the newly introduced metadump v2 format. The tests
can be found at
https://github.com/chandanr/xfstests/commits/metadump-v2.

The patch series can also be obtained from
https://github.com/chandanr/xfsprogs-dev/commits/metadump-v2.

Darrick, Please note that I have removed your RVB from "metadump: Add
support for passing version option" patch. copy_log() and metadump_f()
were invoking set_log_cur() for both "internal log" and "external
log". In the V3 patchset, I have modified the copy_log() function to,
1. Invoke set_log_cur() when the filesystem has an external log.
2. Invoke set_cur() when the filesystem has an internal log.

Changelog:
V2 -> V3:
  1. Document the meanings of metadump v2's ondisk flags.
  2. Rename metadump_ops->end_write() to metadump_ops->finish_dump().
  3. Pass a pointer to the newly introduced "union mdrestore_headers"
     to callbacks in "struct mdrestore_ops" instead of a pointer to
     "void".
  4. Use set_log_cur() only when metadump has to be read from an
     external log device.
  5. Verify that primary superblock read from metadump file was indeed
     read from the data device.
  6. Fix indentation issues.

V1 -> V2:
  1. Introduce the new incompat flag XFS_MD2_INCOMPAT_EXTERNALLOG to
     indicate that the metadump file contains data obtained from an
     external log.
  2. Interpret bits 54 and 55 of xfs_meta_extent.xme_addr as a counter
     such that 00 maps to the data device and 01 maps to the log
     device.
  3. Define the new function set_log_cur() to read from
     internal/external log device. This allows us to continue using
     TYP_LOG to read from both internal and external log.
  4. In order to support reading metadump from a pipe, mdrestore now
     reads the first four bytes of the header to determine the
     metadump version rather than reading the entire header in a
     single call to fread().
  5. Add an ASCII diagram to describe metadump v2's ondisk layout in
     xfs_metadump.h.
  6. Update metadump's man page to indicate that metadump in v2 format
     is generated by default if the filesystem has an external log and
     the metadump version to use is not explicitly mentioned on the
     command line.
  7. Remove '_metadump' suffix from function pointer names in "struct
     metadump_ops".
  8. Use xfs_daddr_t type for declaring variables containing disk
     offset value.
  9. Use bool type rather than int for variables holding a boolean
     value.
  11. Remove unnecessary whitespace.
